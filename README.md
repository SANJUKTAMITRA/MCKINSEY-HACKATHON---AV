# MCKINSEY-HACKATHON---AV
an AV Hackathon: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/mckinsey-analytics-online-hackathon/

secured 44% rank in private leaderboard

I have used Crisp DM framework for this hackathon 
Data preparation steps showed missing value for BMI and Smoking status, after treating them performed Data Visualization to understand
which variables are important or influence stroke 

As the sample was biased I have used random sampling method 1:1 and 2:1 ratio data for model building part
Have used Logistic Regression for this problem and got accuracy and sensitivity over 80% 
KS statistics over 50% 
Gain Chart: Could predict 80% of the patients having stroke in the first four decile records itself \\
